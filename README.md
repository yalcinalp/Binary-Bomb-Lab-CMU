# Binary-Bomb-Lab-CMU
Focusing on reverse engineering skills with machine-level programs, assembly and gdb debugger. A "binary bomb" is a Linux executable C program that consists of six "phases." Each phase expects to enter a particular string on stdin. If we enter the expected string, then that phase is "defused."  Otherwise the bomb "explodes" by printing "BOOM!!!"
